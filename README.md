## Description

As this is my first published ricing. My skills are still poor, it contains a lot of default settings in many packages and others I picked up from other creators

However. I hope this doesn't impact too much on your experience. Hyprland's settings are using the default shortcuts to avoid any problems. I'm not a programmer so there's no installation script

Under construction
